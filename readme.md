#ASCII Art for Brackets
A Brackets extension for using ASCII art for cool lettering, [using patorjk's figlet.js](https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js). All the good stuff is his; all the dumb mistakes are mine. There probably are some, since this is my first time using node.js for anything. Feel free to file bugs and/or feature requests and I'll see what I can do.

                  |___/                       


##Mixes well
with the [wd-minimap extension](https://github.com/websiteduck/brackets-wdminimap) so you can use this [one weird (John Carmack approved) trick](http://klogk.com/posts/use-ascii-art-in-sublime-text/) for faster code navigation. 

##Install
Through the Brackets extension manager.

##Usage
Edit -> Convert to ASCII Art. I think it should be self explanatory from there. 

##Known issues
- ~~The UI is fugly~~
- Selections over more than one line behave oddly

##Missing features
- Kerning options
- A 'quick use' shortcut for using the same font without opening the panel
